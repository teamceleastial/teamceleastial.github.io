        <div id="about-info">
            This mission is a part of the Summer 2020 NASA L’SPACE Mission Concept Academy, 
            which is a NASA Lucy Program designed to teach students how to go 
            about writing and proposing a preliminary design review. We are students from multiple universities and colleges on the 
            East Coast, thus that’s why our name is Ce-L’EAST’-ial! 
            
            
            <br><br>
            Our mission was to design a mission to Mars with a science objective. Throughout
            the summer, we've designed a landing system and a rover for surface operations
            as well as fleshed out the details of our science objectives. We've taken into 
            account safety measures and have developed systems to cross-examine our processes.
            <br><br>
            Our mission, which is called “Undecim Portam,” latin for “eleven's gate,” 
            refers to the Apollo 11 missions to the moon. Instead, our mission is to Mars! 
            <br><br>
            Here is our mission statement pulled from our PDR:
            <br><br>
            The mission goal for Undecim Portam is to search for oxygen wells in Northeast Syrtis as well as for chemical components required for life. This goal is in hopes to better understand the history and geography of Mars as well as to find evidence for seasonal oxygen and methane atmosphere swells through conducting subsurface analysis and high-resolution photos. Subsurface oxygen deposits are a likely candidate for the observed seasonal increase in concentration due to the drastic increases and ruling-out of atmospheric involvement. Additionally, liquid water, ice, novel brines, and geologic features of Mars’ subsurface can be investigated. Identification of such would give further incentive to explore the planet’s geologic makeup and climate relation. Sedimentary rock can give insight to the history of Mars and geologic characteristics it possesses. Though none of these are indicative of life, they all are required for such. Substantial amounts of obtainable oxygen, water, or methane could be used for future manned missions to Mars in both the realm of fuel and respiration or resource usage for personnel. Subsurface data, surface images, and chemical composition data will be gathered to determine the presence of oxygen wells. If the existence of oxygen wells on Mars were to be discovered, techniques to access that oxygen would change future Mars missions. Future missions could utilize these oxygen deposits to resupply missions which would help cut costs, save weight, and preserve other precious materials and resources; thus allowing room for more space and resources to send additional science experiments to Mars. The discovery of oxygen would allow humanity to better understand Mars by enabling all of mankind to further explore Mars due to a potentially drastically lowered barrier to the means of attainable manned voyage and other relevant scientific discoveries.
